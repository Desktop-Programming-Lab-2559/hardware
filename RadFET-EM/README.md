# RadFET - Total Ionising Radiation Dose Sensor 

Here you can find engineering (development) versions of RadFET sensor and calibration stands designs. The flight verions was integrated with [Payload board (PLD)](https://github.com/PW-Sat2/hardware/tree/master/PLD).


# RadFET Development versions

* **RadFET_Stand_v1** - calibration and test stand for 3N163 transistors
* **RadFET_Stand_v2** - calibration and test stand for CD4007 transistors
* **RadFET_EM1** - schematic identical to flight model
