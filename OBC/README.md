# On-Board Computer development board
This OBC dev board was designed to speed up software development process. This OBC dev board is software-compatible with the flight OBC but there are significant differences in hardware. SRAM EDAC and latch-up protections were not implemented here. So it is not ready to launch but it successfully mocks the real OBC. In addition, there are additional debug LEDs and connectors.
